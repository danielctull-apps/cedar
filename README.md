# cedar

A tiny graphical text editor for use from the command line.

## Installation

I recommend using the awesome utility [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint) to install cedar.

```sh
mint install danielctull-apps/cedar
```

## Usage

cedar can only be run from the command line and it takes just one argument, the file you wish to open.

```sh
cedar <file>
```

### Using as git editor

cedar is designed to open really fast so is perfect for using as a git editor. If you wish to use cedar as your editor of choice when running those beloved commands [`git commit`](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) or [`git rebase -i`](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase), perform the following command and it will be set in your global [git configuration](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration) file.

```sh
git config --global core.editor cedar
```
